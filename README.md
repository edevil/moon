# Exposure

Exposure is an [Ethereum ERC20][1] token specifically created for the Pixels Camp participants. Its primary purpose is to help developers get familiarized with the Ethereum Blockchain technology and to foster experimentation of new ideas and applications on top of it.

Each new participant will be issued with Exposure tokens for every badge their earn. More badges equals more Expo$ure. Rare badges equals even more Expo$ure.

Our digital coin can be used with many activities around the Pixels Camp event and community, including investing in the hackathon projects, essencially substituting the voting system, or buying services. You can see a list of uses below.

The participants can also trade their tokens with anyone they wish.

The symbol for Exposure is EXP.

EXP runs on our Ethereum Testnet and is ruled by a smart contract at the address `0x0ce335bb2d04595c84e3d444675360f64de386e8`.

You can interact and inspect the contract [here][8], and sources are [here][9].

The name was inspired by the famous [You're doing it for the exposure][2] cartoon from The Oatmeal.

## Inital setup

To start using EXP, first, you need to get yourself a wallet. In Ethereum, or most blockchains, the simplest form of a wallet is a public address, which you use to send money/tokens/data to, and a private key, which you should store securely in place no one can access.

Some wallet applications will use passwords or mnemonics to make things easier for you, but that's just convenience. Deep inside their guts, all they're doing is managing your private key.

Two things you need to know:

The private key generates your public address.
Anyone with your private key can access your wallet and steal your money or tokens, and there's nothing you can do about it.

There are many ways to create a wallet, and we're pretty sure that soon you'll be digging into command line python or nodejs code to manage this task, but for the time being, let's keep it simple. Here are two methods, GUI based to create your wallet:

 * Create wallet using the [Pixels Camp MEW website][10] (recommended)
 * Create wallet using the [Metamask][11] Chrome Extension
