# Pixels Camp Market

The Pixels Camp open market is a way for participants to sell or buy services during the event using the EXP tokens in their balances.

Anyone can apply to sell a service, and anyone can buy services from others.

You can purchase a service to get help for your team, for example requesting time from a web designer, or get access to an exceptional mentor, or to advertise your project. Imagination is the limit.

The reasoning behind is, you spend and earn EXPs to increase your chances of winning the hackathon, either because you need the service because you'd get a better project, or because you need the money to invest in it.
